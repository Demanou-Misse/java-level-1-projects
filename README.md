Java Level 1 Projects 🚀

Welcome! This repository contains six beginner-level Java projects I created as part of my learning journey. These projects focus on core concepts such as variables, conditions, loops, arrays, user input, and basic logic.

Each project has its own folder, description, and source code. Feel free to explore, run, and even improve them!

📚 Projects Overview

✅ 1. Basic Calculator (Console)
Goals:
- Learn variables, operators, conditions, loops
- Practice using `Scanner` and `switch`

What it does:
- Takes two numbers as input
- Lets the user choose an operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Uses `switch` to perform the operation and loops to repeat

📌 Concepts Used: `Scanner`, `switch`, `if`, `while`, `variables`, `Math`, `String`

📂 Folder: `/basic-calculator`

✅ 2. Interactive Mini-Quiz
Goals:
- Practice strings, arrays, loops, and conditional logic

What it does:
- Asks 5 questions with 3 possible answers (A, B, C)
- Evaluates answers and shows the final score
- Includes an option to restart

📌 **Concepts Used:** `arrays`, `String`, `for`, `if/else`, `Scanner`, `boolean`, `continue`, `break`

📂 Folder: `/mini-quiz`

✅ 3. Contact Manager (Console)
Goals:
- Work with arrays and loops to manage simple data

What it does:
- Add, display, and search contacts (name + phone)
- Stores up to 10 contacts

📌 **Concepts Used:** `arrays`, `String`, `while`, `if/else`, `Scanner`

📂 Folder: `/contact-manager`

✅ 4. Random Password Generator
Goals:
- Use randomness, strings, loops, and arrays

What it does:
- Asks the user for password length
- Generates a random password with letters, numbers, symbols

📌 **Concepts Used:** `String`, `Math.random()`, `char arrays`, `for`, `Scanner`

📂 Folder: `/password-generator`

✅ 5. Guess the Number Game
Goals:
- Practice logic and user interaction in loops

What it does:
- Random number between 1 and 100
- User tries to guess; hints are given
- Counts attempts and shows final result

📌 Concepts Used: `Math.random()`, `Scanner`, `while`, `if/else`, `int`, `boolean`

📂 Folder: `/guess-the-number`

---

✅ 6. Currency Converter
Goals:
- Apply type casting, calculations, input, and decision-making

What it does:
- Converts between FCFA, USD, and EUR using fixed rates
- Input amount + choice → shows rounded result

📌 Concepts Used: `double`, `switch`, `Scanner`, `type casting`, `Math.round()`, `if/else`

📂 Folder: `/currency-converter`
